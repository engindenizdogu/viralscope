I asked you guys on my community page if I should investigate who her crush is, so I totally did it! Carter Sharer was definitely hanging around Lizzy a lot, but so was Hunter - Carter's camera man, and Stove...who is their other friend. It's pretty confusing, but be sure and comment #crush and who you think it is.\nComment #crush and tell me who you think it is!\n\nCatch up on all the details on Lizzy's Channel:\nI HAVE A CRUSH... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp_6E-i9FrY\nI TEXTED MY CRUSH… 😳(SONG LYRIC PRANK!!) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOk-dHruuIE\n\n\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/carlandjinger\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/Jingerrific\n► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jingerrific\n► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/carlandjinger/\n\nOur Channels:\nCarl & Jinger Family: https://goo.gl/rsnnzi\nKyle's Toys and Games: https://goo.gl/tXdtZH\nLuke Fully Loaded: https://goo.gl/tr5OWJ\nGage1Up: https://goo.gl/PYUibl",
